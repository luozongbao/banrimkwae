I want to create hotel/Resort Managment.  The resort called Banrimkwae.

Can you help draft standard requirements for the project.  Banrimkwae has two types of accommodations: raft and house. Each raft and house have different number of rooms so it should be manageable which might not be the same room types. we also have restaurant that the guests could also put their expense on their bills and pay their expense at the lobby on checkout. So, I guess to do that, we also might have to include the restaurant order and billing system in the project. banrimkwae also have problem with stock management, so it is best to have stock management integrated into the system for the restaurant part and the resort part.
