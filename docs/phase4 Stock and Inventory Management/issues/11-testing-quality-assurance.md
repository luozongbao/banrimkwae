    }
    
    public function test_automated_reorder_triggers_correctly()
    {
        // Test implementation
    }
    
    public function test_stock_movement_updates_correctly()
    {
        // Test implementation
    }
}

// tests/Unit/Services/InventoryServiceTest.php
class InventoryServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_calculate_reorder_point()
    {
        // Test business logic
    }
    
    public function test_process_stock_adjustment()
    {
        // Test stock calculations
    }
}
```

### Frontend Testing Stack
```javascript
// src/components/__tests__/InventoryDashboard.test.jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import InventoryDashboard from '../InventoryDashboard';

describe('InventoryDashboard', () => {
  test('renders dashboard with correct data', () => {
    // Test component rendering
  });
  
  test('handles stock level alerts', () => {
    // Test alert functionality
  });
  
  test('filters inventory by category', () => {
    // Test filtering logic
  });
});

// src/hooks/__tests__/useInventory.test.js
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';
