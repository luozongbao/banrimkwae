# ABOUT BANRIMKWAE RESORT
Banrimkwae is an activity resort in Kanchanaburi. Banrimkwae has two types of accommodations: raft and house. Each raft and house have different number of rooms so it should be manageable which might not be the same room types. we also have restaurant that the guests could also put their expense on their bills and pay their expense at the lobby on checkout. So, I guess to do that, we also might have to include the restaurant order and billing system in the project. banrimkwae also have problem with stock management, so it is best to have stock management integrated into the system for the restaurant part and the resort part.


Banrimkwae is an activity resort, some activities are free for all guests, some activites must purchase to join, sometime those must purchase activities are also included in a sale package.
