# Banrimkwae resort Management System
## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive management system for Banrimkwae Resort, which includes various modules to handle different aspects of the resort's operations. The system will cover the following key areas:

The Project must have comprehensive Role Mangement, Staff Mangement, User management, Consistent Style and Profile, Guest Interface Area like Accommodation/Activity Booking and Menu Ordering, Staff Interface like Accommodation Management, Activity Management, Restaurant Managment, Stock/Inventory Management, and Report for each Management System. Staff Interface pages can defined accessability through role management.  This Project should be in Web Application and Mobile Application.

We can put development into small phases 4-6 weeks each, User Mangement and Framework, Accommodation and Activity, Restaurant Mangement, Stock or Inventory Mangement,API Management, Mobile Application, and Reporting.

The project should be developed using the latest technologies and frameworks to ensure scalability and maintainability. The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing for easy navigation and access to features. (I prefer PHP and JavaScript for the backend and frontend development, respectively, but other technologies can be considered based on team expertise and project requirements. Database mangement should be handled using a robust system like MySQL or MariaDB.) 

The system should be designed to handle a large number of users and transactions efficiently, with a focus on performance and security.
