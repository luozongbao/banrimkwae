INSERT INTO accommodations (name, type, description, max_guests, price_per_night) VALUES
('Floating Paradise Raft', 'raft', 'Luxury floating accommodation with river views', 4, 2500.00),
('Traditional Thai House', 'house', 'Authentic wooden house in tropical setting', 6, 3500.00),
('Riverside Raft Deluxe', 'raft', 'Premium raft with modern amenities', 2, 3000.00);

```

### Feedback Collection Framework
```javascript
// UAT Feedback Collection Component
const UATFeedbackForm = () => {
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState({
    feature: '',
    usability_rating: 0,
    performance_rating: 0,
    satisfaction_rating: 0,
    issues_found: [],
    suggestions: '',
    overall_experience: ''
  });

  const submitFeedback = async () => {
    await fetch('/api/uat-feedback', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        ...feedback,
        user_role: currentUser.role,
        test_scenario: currentScenario,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        session_id: sessionId
      })
    });
  };

  return (
    <FeedbackForm
      onSubmit={submitFeedback}
      fields={[
        { name: 'usability_rating', type: 'rating', max: 5 },
        { name: 'performance_rating', type: 'rating', max: 5 },
        { name: 'satisfaction_rating', type: 'rating', max: 5 },
        { name: 'issues_found', type: 'checkbox-list', options: commonIssues },
        { name: 'suggestions', type: 'textarea' }
      ]}
    />
  );
};
```

### Performance Metrics Collection
```javascript
// UAT Performance Monitoring
class UATPerformanceMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = {
      page_load_times: [],
      api_response_times: [],
      user_interactions: [],
      error_occurrences: []
    };
  }

  trackPageLoad(pageName, loadTime) {
    this.metrics.page_load_times.push({
      page: pageName,
      load_time: loadTime,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      user_role: this.getCurrentUserRole()
    });
  }

  trackAPICall(endpoint, responseTime, success) {
    this.metrics.api_response_times.push({
      endpoint,
      response_time: responseTime,
      success,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }

  generateReport() {
    return {
      average_page_load: this.calculateAverage(this.metrics.page_load_times, 'load_time'),
      average_api_response: this.calculateAverage(this.metrics.api_response_times, 'response_time'),
      error_rate: this.calculateErrorRate(),
      user_satisfaction: this.calculateSatisfactionScore()
    };
  }
}
```
